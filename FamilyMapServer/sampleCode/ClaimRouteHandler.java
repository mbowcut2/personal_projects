/*
	The ClaimRouteHandler is the HTTP handler that processes
	incoming HTTP requests that contain the "/routes/claim" URL path.
	
	Notice that ClaimRouteHandler implements the HttpHandler interface,
	which is defined by Java.  This interface contains only one method
	named "handle".  When the HttpServer object (declared in the Server class)
	receives a request containing the "/routes/claim" URL path, it calls 
	ClaimRouteHandler.handle() which actually processes the request.

    // (i.e., the client and server exchange a request and response).
    // The HttpExchange object gives the handler access to all of the
    // details of the HTTP request (Request type [GET or POST],
    // request headers, request body, etc.).
    // The HttpExchange object also gives the handler the ability
    // to construct an HTTP response and send it back to the client

        // 2. How to access HTTP request headers
        // 3. How to read JSON data from the HTTP request body
        // 4. How to return the desired status code (200, 404, etc.)
